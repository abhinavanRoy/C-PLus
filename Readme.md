**DATA STRUCTURES**

In this repository of C++ programming i am going to concentrate on Data Structres including: Arrays - Linked List - Stacks - Queues - Trees

**1. Arrays**

-> An array is defined as a collection of data elements of the same type(same datatype) that are stored in contagious memory locations.
-> The size of an array is fixed and hence once declared the size of the array cannot be changed.
-> The elements of an array are refrenced using index numbers.

The array section will have the following programs:

* Creating an array of size n and displaying its elements.
* Finding the maximum and minimum elements in an array.
* Deleting an element from an array.
* Left rotation of array elements.

**2. Linked List**
     
-> A linked list can defined as a group or collection of nodes which are interconnected through a link, hence called linked lists.
-> A node in a linked list consists of two parts 1.The data part which consists of value/data.
                                                 2.The address part stores the address of the next node in the linked list.

-> Linked list does not store its nodes in contagious memory locations.
-> Linked list does not allow random access of data that is to access a particular node we have to traverse the entire list till the node      
   is found.

Linked lists are of the following types:

*** Simple Linked List**

->In simple linked list we have:

* Add node at the start of list
* Add node at the end of the list
* Add node after a node particular data
* Add node before a node of particular data
* Delete a node from the beginning of list
* Delete a node from the end of list
* Delete a node after a given node

    
**Further topics and programs will be added soon in future**
