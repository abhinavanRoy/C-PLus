DATA STRUCTURES

In this repository of C++ programming i am going to concentrate on Data Structres including: Arrays - Linked List - Stacks - Queues - Trees

1. Arrays

-> An array is defined as a collection of data elements of the same type(same datatype) that are stored in contagious memory locations.
-> The size of an array is fixed and hence once declared the size of the array cannot be changed.
-> The elements of an array are refrenced using index numbers.

The array section will have the following programs:

* Creating an array of size n and displaying its elements.
* Finding the maximum and minimum elements in an array.
* Deleting an element from an array.
* Left rotation of array elements.

**Further topics and programs will be added soon in future**
